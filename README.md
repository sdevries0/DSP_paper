# Discovering Dynamic Symbolic Policies with Genetic Programming

In this repository, you can find the source code used for the paper "Discovering Dynamic Symbolic Policies with Genetic Programming". Click [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02765) to read the paper. 
In this paper, we used genetic programming to evolve control policies consisting of symbolic expressions, both with and without memory. 
The code makes use of the [Kozax](https://github.com/sdevries0/Kozax) framework, which runs genetic programming in JAX.
